  %p Founded by <a href="http://www.dylanfareed.com">Dylan Fareed</a> in 2015, Dispatches is a multi-disciplinary product design practice in New York City.
  %p Our mission is is to organize the world's information and make it universally accessible and useful.
  %p Short of that, we aim to prototype, manufacture and sell four physical products in a variety of materials each year.
  %p Initially, Dispatches is releasing two products Dylan Fareed designed with Hunter Craighill at <a href='http://www.genmfg.co/'>GENMFGCO</a> in 2013 and 2014, <a href='/products/tybee-jump-rope'>the Tybee Jump Rope</a> and <a href='/products/bozeman-coat-rack'>the Bozeman Coat Rack</a>. We are slowly slouching towards another new product release in January 2016 with additional items every three months thereafter.
  %p We work closely with a handful of American manufacturers to produce objects that uniquely combine utility, handsomeness, and durablity.
  %p We make things that we hope will grow old with you.
