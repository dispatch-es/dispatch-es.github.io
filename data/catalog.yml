  sizing: |
    The table below matches leather lengths to optimal height ranges for jump rope enthusiasts. Your mileage may vary—some folks have very long arms relative to their heights.

    Leather length  | Corresponding Height
    --------------- | ---------------
    118 inches      | 5’1" – 5’4"
    124 inches      | 5’5" – 5’8"
    130 inches      | 5’9" – 6’

  care: |
    Once a year or as needed, apply neatsfoot oil to the leather cord to prevent drying or cracking.
