    The <em>Tybee Jump Rope</em> is a handsome and performant new classic.

    It is cleverly assembled from the simple combination of turned wooden handles, leather cord, and paracord. As a last step, a little boiling water is used to bind them all together.

  fabrication: |
    Handle

    * Walnut or maple hardwood
    * 5&#215;1.25&#8243;
    * CNC machined in Michigan; laser engraved in Pennsylvania

    * American leather
    * Variable lengths; 1/4 inch diameter

  sizing: |
    Leather length  | Corresponding Height
    --------------- | ---------------
    118 inches      | 5’1" – 5’4"
    124 inches      | 5’5" – 5’8"
    130 inches      | 5’9" – 6’
    136 inches      | 6’1 – 6’4"
    142 inches      | 6’5" – 6’8"

    The table above matches leather lengths to optimal height ranges for jump rope enthusiasts. Your mileage may vary—some folks have very long arms relative to their heights.

  care: |
    Once a year or as needed, apply neatsfoot oil to the leather cord to prevent drying or cracking.
